\subsection{Behavioral fault modeling}
In this section, we describe how to integrate a component's faulty behavior from system fault tree\cite{ft} into the BIP model. First, we decompose the system fault tree. Then we deduce a faulty behavior from each leaf node of the system fault tree. Next, we generate a BIP component with faulty behavior according to its nominal behavior BIP model. Afterwards, we put the behavioral fault component and the nominal behavior component together with a manager component deciding and monitoring the activition of both fault and nominal behavior components. Finally, we modifies the connection between each component to ensure the input and output ports are the same as the original BIP component. The result of the integration is a fault-based BIP component.

\textbf{Example 1.} We take a commonly used valve component as an example. In general, a valve is used to control the passage of hydraulic pressure. When the valve is open, the output hydraulic pressure is equal to the input hydraulic pressure, indicates that the valve currently allows hydraulic pressure to pass. When the valve is close, the output hydraulic pressure is zero, indicates a rejection of hydraulic passage. We model the nominal behavior of valve in BIP, as shown in Fig.~\ref{example_BIP_nominal}.

	\caption{Fault tree for a loss of valve occurrence}
	\label{example_valve_fault_tree}
\end{figure}

Fig.~\ref{example_valve_fault_tree} shows the failure of valve. A loss of valve occurs when the valve is stuck at open or it is stuck at close. We deduce two faulty behaviors for the valve component from the leaf nodes of this fault tree, the stack-at-open fault and stuck-at-close fault. For stuck-at-open fault, the output hydraulic pressure is always the same as the input, while for stuck-at-close fault, the output hydraulic pressure is always zero.

\emph{The integration steps.} We conclude our methodology of integrating and transforming the fault tree of Fig.~\ref{example_valve_fault_tree} into the valve component BIP model shown in Fig.~\ref{example_BIP_nominal} by the following steps:

Step1: Deduce the faulty behavior from the fault tree. The top level fault, which is the loss of valve in this case, will occur through the combination of the leaf nodes with the gates. We focus on each leaf node to translate them into faulty behaviors respectively. For this case, the two leaf nodes are translated as follows:

\begin{itemize}
	\item For stuck-at-open fault, the output hydraulic pressure is always the same as the input.
	\item For stuck-at-close fault, the output hydraulic pressure is always zero.
\end{itemize}

Step2: Generate BIP component with faulty behavior. Comparing with the nominal behavior valve component, the valve with stuck at open/close fault shows an eternally unblocked/blocked for both \emph{Open} and \emph{Close} status respectively. According to step 2, the faulty behavior valve components are generated as follows:

\begin{itemize}
	\item For both faulty behavior components, the transition among \emph{Open} and \emph{Close} status will no longer change the value of \emph{PreOut}.
	\item For stuck-at-open component, the action of transition from status \emph{Close} to \emph{Close} under event \emph{Input} is \emph{PreOut:=PreIn}, just the same as transition from status \emph{Open} to \emph{Open} under event \emph{Input}.
	\item For stuck-at-close component, the action of transition from status \emph{Open} to \emph{Open} under event \emph{Input} is \emph{PreOut:=0}, just the same as transition from status \emph{Close} to \emph{Close} under event \emph{Input}.
\end{itemize}

Step3: Design a manager component for deciding and monitoring the activition of both fault and nominal behavior components. In this example, we design a manager component with three states, each of them represents one kind of valve status. Once the state execute a self circulation, an event will be sent to the corresponding behavioral component to activate it. The three states switch through internal port \emph{Trigger} which is controlled by BIP enigne to support a stochastic process of faulty behavior occured during simulation.

Step4: Since the original component has been integrated with faulty behavior, it keeps the same external port for connection  as before but has been extended a lower level to contain various of components designed in the previous steps. Modifying the upward connectors from components to the compound and extending each component with an external port receiving activation event. Confirming the extended system model without fault keeps consistence of the norminal system model through observing their transition of status, internal and external ports and connectors(This will be reconfirmed by tracing the simulation result).

As a result of integration of valve component and fault tree, Fig.~\ref{Example} shows the valve compound containing a valve component with nominal behavior, two valve components with faulty behavior and a manager component. Using this BIP model, we integrate failure into the software behavior instead of separating the hardware failure from software system. As hierarchies of complex components, the integrated compound helps us observe the system behavior through graphical representation of BIP model. Also, further simulation and validation of tracing faulty behavior using stochastic BIP engine becomes possible.

\subsection{Fault trees for the WBS}
Fig.~\ref{WBS_BIP_fault_tree} shows a fault tree for ``Loss of wheel braking" event, which is based on the AIR6110 standard description. Loss of wheel braking is caused either through the Loss of operaton of physical system or due to the loss of BSCU. We focus on the leaf nodes which represent faulty behavior for their component respectively. Notice that the expansion of the fault tree nodes ``Loss of BSCU channel 1/2" are carried out but not included in Fig.~\ref{WBS_BIP_fault_tree} for the sake of brevity.

We deduce the faulty behaviors for every component from the fault tree shown in Fig.~\ref{WBS_BIP_fault_tree}. Also, we consider the compound \emph{BSCU Channel 1/2} as the lowest level of component for the sake of brevity. A statistics of deduced faulty behaviors is given in Table.~\ref{tab1}. The selector valve's faulty behavior is loss of its selector function, while each BSCU channel has three faulty behaviors including ``loss of power supply", ``loss of monitor system" and ``command system does not operate".

\subsection{Extended WBS Model with faults}
In this section, we give a whole view of modified BIP model which is integrated with fault tree introduced in section \emph{B} using the methodology provided in seciton \emph{A}.

Table.~\ref{tab2} shows metrics for the different architectures. We focus on observing the diversities between the adjacent architectures and the differences between the nominal system architecture and extended system architecture. The count of max depth of each architecture provides an overview of the usage of hierarchies of complex components. The count of internal ports indicating the number of inner transitions with guard in every component while the count of external ports indicating the number of outer interface of each component.

We can conclude that the later the design version of the architecture, the greater the scale of the BIP model. ARCH1 shows a large delta comparing with other three architectures. From ARCH2 to ARCH3, there is a differ from the design for the BSCU. For ARCH2, the AIR6110 standard only requires a redundency of BSCU which results in a WBS model including two identical BSCU system. For ARCH3, motivated by trade studies on ARCH2, the strcture is modified from two BSCUs to a BSCU with dual channels. Also, as the result of integration, the extended BIP model with faulty behavior presents a larger scale than the nominal BIP model. ARCH3 and ARCH4 show the closest metrics for there is only a little change in the physical system.

The graphical representation of the BIP model can seperate the correct behavior from the faulty behavior to a great extent. This helps us tracing how a single point of failure impacts the system and whether it will cause a top level failure or not.

You can find the nominal WBS model or the BIP model extended with the faults described in the fault tree in section \emph{B}. The full system implementation can be found at \href{https://github.com/Rosaugo/WBSFaultModelingBIP}{https://github.com/Rosaugo/WBSFaultModelingBIP}.
