Giving introduction of BIP framework, BIP toolset, SBIP and, on the other hand, fault tree-based safety analysis.

Model based design is becoming an increasingly important approach for the development of safety critical systems.
 The functional behavior and the architecture of the system can be modelled in some formal language using graphical or textual representations.
 This formal model is called the nominal system model can be subjected to various analysis such as simulation, verification and testing.
 Code generation is also supported to derive implementations directly from high level models.
 In model based safety analysis, the nominal system model is then augmented with fault models for the digital and mechanical systems to create an extended system model.
 This model can be used to describe the behavior of the system in the presence of one or more faults.
