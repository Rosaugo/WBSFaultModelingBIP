\begin{abstract}
BIP (Behavior-Interaction-Priority) is a component-based framework for rigorous design of complex systems. 
 Systems are modeled by a set of components and connectors.
 Behavioral fault modeling and analysis refers to an integration of model based system design and safety analysis. 
 In this paper, we integrate fault tree based safety analysis into BIP model and 
 apply statistical model checking to verify system specification and calculate probability of fault issues. 
 We also trace the simulation result to confirm the extended system model without fault keeps consistence of the nominal system model.
 We illustrate an airplane wheel brake system meeting the industry standards as case study 
 to show its advantage in analyzing fault behavior of safety-critical systems in aerospace practice.

\section{Conclusions and Future Work}
This paper proposes a model of the wheel brake system based on behavioral fault modeling approach as well as a verification technique based on statistical model checking. Our design tightly follows the AIR6110 standard with a result of four architectures. The work of [mail aadl][aadl] focused on an extension of AADL Error Model called Annex, using WBS as an example. They find it hard to adding faults to existing components, and the integration process can obscure the nominal behaviors of the model. The paper [cav] proposes a formal modeling and analysis of WBS based on an integration of serveral approaches including OCRA, NuXmv and xSAP. They using a cluster of machines with massive memories and time, but also faces with time out problems during computation. However (1) our model is more easier to extend/modify due to the use of the component-based design approach, (2) the integrated model is more concrete due to the use of our behavioral fault modeling approach, (3) we are capable to retreive stochastic informations on the wheel brake system, (3) our approach is adaptive.
