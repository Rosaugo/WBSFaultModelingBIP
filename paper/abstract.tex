\begin{abstract}
In this case study, we apply architecture-based rigorous system design approach to the control software of the airplane engine controller.
Rigorous system design refers to a formal model-based process that leads from requirements to correct implementations.
Architectures are a means for ensuring global coordination properties of system models and thus, achieving design correctness by construction.
%
We implement the architecture diagrams for airplane engine control software in the Behavior-Interaction-Priority (BIP) component-based framework.
We show how to obtain a system model by applying architectures to a set of atomic components.
We also perform deadlock freedom analysis of the resulting system model by using the BIP tool-set and 
additionally validation analysis of our approach by using nuXmv model checker to verify that the safety properties enforced by the architecture are indeed satisfied.
